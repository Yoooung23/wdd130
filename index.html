            <p>Hi I'm Logan Young, a Software Engineering student. some of my hobbies include; Rock climbing, parkour, and woodworking. </p>
            <p>I've been married for a year and a half now and am so blessed to have my sweet wife.</p>
            <p>My goal is to become a successful software engineer and make a difference in the world</p>
            <p>I have always loved to create, growing up, for me it was always: </p>
            <a href="https://www.lego.com" target="_blank">LEGOS</a>
            <p>I grew up in the Church, but found my personal reasons for conversion to Jesus Christ when I was 17-18 years old.</p>
            <p>My favorite quote would be from Elder Holland: "We must declare, as young Nephi did in his, “I will give place no more for the enemy of my soul.”</p>
